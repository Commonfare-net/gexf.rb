# Gexf.rb

A Ruby library for reading, writing, and manipulating graphs expressed in the [GEXF](http://gexf.net) format.
Currently, this project implements only a subset of the GEXF specs: namely, the definition of a basic graph topology,
and the association of data attributes to nodes and edges. I will possibly implement the other part of the specification
(i.e. dynamics, hyrarchy, and Phylogeny) later, as I consolidate the code.

Work in progress..
