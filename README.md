# Gexf.rb

## Ruby implementation of the GEXF specification.

GEXF is an [XML vocabulary](http://gexf.net/) designed for describing complex graph structures. The format has been already
adopted by graph visualisation and manipulation software [Gephi](http://gephi.org/), and most recently by browser-based 
graph drawing library [Sigma.js](http://sigmajs.org/). Gexf.rb is my modest attempt at a basic Ruby implementation of the spec.

WIP.. more soon
